## Idea:
Design The overall architecture of the system will consist of a central server that communicates with the smart home devices and a mobile app that provides the user interface. The server will use the Python Adafruit-io library to communicate with the devices using the virtual COM serial communication protocol. The mobile app will use the REST API and MQTT client to communicate with the server and control the devices.


## Features:
1. Turn on the light and pump through Smartphone

2. Monitor the temperature and humidity of the house

3. Check the weather outside

4. Timer to turn the pump on/off

5. Open/Close door using face recognition

6. Camera base monitoring
